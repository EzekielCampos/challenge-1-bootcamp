# Challenge 1 UC Berkeley Extension Refactoring Code

## Description
For this assignment existing code was given to the programmer to be refactored to meet common set of standards that are best practices used in the industry.  Semantic elements were updated and rearranged to be better organized and provide more information for the browser.  The image attributes were updated to include an "alt" attribute with an appropriate description.  All code was commented in both html and css files to add more clarity to the code.  The stylesheet was consolidated to reduce the amount of code that was necessary.  Refactoring is a good method to consolidate and review code so that when another programmer views it, the code is clearer and optimized to perform its best.
